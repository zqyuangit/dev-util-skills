# API Contract Designer

## Overview

Turn business rules and source examples into explicit API contracts. Make endpoint boundaries, request and response structures, validation rules, and error semantics unambiguous before implementation starts.

## Workflow

### 1. Start from existing patterns

Look for project-level conventions before inventing new ones:

- response envelope
- field naming style
- status code usage
- auth model
- pagination shape
- filtering and sorting patterns

If the source materials already establish a pattern, preserve it unless there is a concrete reason to change it.

### 2. Define endpoint boundaries

State:

- the business capability each endpoint serves
- the owning module or resource boundary
- the caller assumptions
- whether the endpoint is read, write, or asynchronous trigger

Avoid mixing unrelated responsibilities into one contract.

### 3. Specify each contract explicitly

For every endpoint, define:

- method and path
- purpose
- auth or caller constraints
- security configuration impact, including whether route allowlists or guards must change
- request parameters
- request body shape
- response shape
- status and error outcomes
- edge-case behavior

Mark fields as required, optional, derived, or server-controlled.

Security allowlist check: for public recovery or session endpoints, explicitly state whether the security layer permits anonymous access, authenticated access, role-based access, CSRF behavior, and rate-limit expectations. Do not assume adding the controller route makes the endpoint usable.

### 4. Standardize the shared contract layer

Describe the shared rules once:

- response envelope
- error envelope
- pagination structure
- idempotency behavior
- validation failure behavior
- trace or request identifiers when relevant

Do not leave these as implied conventions if multiple endpoints depend on them.

### 5. Surface weak points

Call out places where the contract is still underdefined, such as:

- unclear ownership of a field
- missing business validation rules
- conflicting source examples
- uncertain status code semantics
- missing async or retry behavior

## Output Shape

Use the `API Contract Package` structure in `references/output-templates.md`.

The minimum output should cover:

1. API purpose and assumptions
2. Existing patterns or source references
3. Endpoint list
4. Per-endpoint contract details
5. Shared response and error model
6. Validation and edge cases
7. Open questions

## Guardrails

- Do not reduce the work to curl or fetch snippets.
- Do not output OpenAPI unless the user asks for it.
- Do not assume REST purity matters more than project consistency.
- Keep the main artifact contract-first, not client-example-first.
- Keep long contract documents easy to scan in Markdown readers:
  - add a short overview or endpoint map before detailed sections
  - group endpoints by resource or workflow, not by arbitrary numbering alone
  - use short explanatory lead-ins before dense tables
  - keep paragraphs short and avoid large uninterrupted walls of field definitions
  - add quick-locate hints for common caller paths such as auth, learner flow, admin flow, or internal APIs
  - when many shared structures exist, include a compact “most important updates” summary near the top

## Quick Checklist

- Is module ownership clear?
- Are request and response shapes explicit?
- Are required versus optional fields marked?
- Are auth, route allowlists, and validation rules visible?
- Are pagination, filtering, and sorting conventions covered where relevant?
- Are error semantics and edge cases spelled out?
- Does the contract identify every link needed for use: frontend/API helper, controller, security, service, repository, and tests?
